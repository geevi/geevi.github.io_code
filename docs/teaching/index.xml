      <description>Deep Neural Networks, while being unreasonably effective for several vision tasks, have their usage limited by the computational and memory requirements, both during training and inference stages. Analyzing and improving the connectivity patterns between layers of a network has resulted in several compact architectures like GoogleNet, ResNet and DenseNet-BC. We survey the most recent developments giving CNN architectures with better error vs resourse (parameters/FLOPs/energy/memory/fps) tradeoffs.
We also plan to learn how to do fast implementations of CNNs in existing processing architectures.</description>

      <description>Multi Object Tracking is the task tracking objects in video frames. We survey the various types of MOT methods, with special focus on the latest methods that use Deep Learning.

      <title>Complexity Theory</title>

      <description>Complexity theory studies what problems can and cannot be solved by computers given limited running time and memory resources.
Students are expected to read the corresponding chapter from the textbook (mentioned under readings), before attending the lecture. The lecture is mainly for clearing doubts and covering the most confusing parts.
The is a short course with 13 lectures for students who might not have taken a Theory of Computation course.</description>
