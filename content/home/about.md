<h2>Hi!</h2>
I am a scientist of Machine Learning at the [Machine Learning Lab](http://mll.iiit.ac.in/) at [IIIT Hyderabad](http://iiit.ac.in/). My primary research topic is Deep Learning, specifically [Model Compression](/project/model-compression/) techniques and Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Navigation.

Previously I did my [Phd thesis](/publication/thesis/) on Computational Complexity theory and continues to have interest in [Complexity theory](/project/pcps/), Combinatorics and Graph theory.
