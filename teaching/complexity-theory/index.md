### Complexity Theory
<span style="display: block; padding-bottom: 10px; font-size: 18px; text-align: center; font-weight: 300;
border-bottom: gray 1px dotted;">
Complexity theory studies what problems can and cannot be solved by computers given limited running time and memory resources.  
</span>

Students are expected to read the corresponding chapter from the textbook (mentioned under readings), before attending the lecture. 
The lecture is mainly for clearing doubts and covering the most confusing parts.

The is a short course with 13 lectures for students who might not have
taken a Theory of Computation course. However sufficient knowledge of 
discrete maths and algorithms is assumed. It is not supposed to be a 
rigorous one, for research student, but rather an introduction to field 
of complexity theory.

#### Grading

This part of the course will have a total of 50 marks + 5 bonus marks.

- 25 marks for the end sem.
- 15 marks for the mid sem.
- 10 marks for assignments.
- 5 marks for quiz.

2-3 question will be given out at the end of every lecture. There will be one tutorial 
session per week (to be scheduled), where the assignments for the previous week will be collected, and 
solutions will be discussed.
